- 👋 Hi, I’m @Wjardimusashi
- 👀 I'm interested in learning better how to program to build a game among other projects such as building an app.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Java OOP and I'm open to receiving help and guidance on how my development as a programmer can improve! I accept recommendations for books that have made and continue to make a difference in the lives of long-time programmers.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects to develop gamers. But I'm not just closed off. In any case, any knowledge that can add or absorb me.
- 📫 How to reach me is very simple. @walasse Jardim, so you can find me on social media.
- 😄 Pronouns: 
- ⚡ Curiosity: I am a capoerista and pedagogue, I have a great interest in philosophy, physics, particle physics, history, the history of religions and I am in search of the greatest secret that has been hidden from us... this search is progressing well! ;D
